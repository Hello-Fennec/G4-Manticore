            <p>The manticore, derived from the Early Middle Persian merthykhuwar or martiora, meaning "man-eater" 
                (also known as a mantichora or a martichore), is a fearsome hybrid creature found in classical and medieval literature. 
                It has the body of a lion, the head of a man and a scorpion tail that can shoot poisonous darts.</p>

        <div class="top-topic02">
            <p>The manticore is one of the most bizarre and ferocious creatures depicted throughout classical and medieval bestiaries. 
                Its roots can be traced back to India and Persia (modern-day Iran). The myth of the manticore spreads over several 
                centuries and is mentioned most famously by Ctesias (5th century BCE), Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) and Pausanias 
                (c. 115 to c. 180 CE).</p>

            <h4 class="origin-head">Origin</h4>
            <p>The manticore was thought to have its origins in ancient India and Persia. It debuts, with its appearance in around 700 
                BCE and usually ends at around the 9th Century.  Some sources state that it originated in ancient Persian mythology, 
                while others claim that it was an Indian creature. According to Aelian in his Characteristics of Animals, "Ctesias 
                claims to have seen one such creature which was brought to the Persian king as a gift" (4.21). Other writers back up 
                this claim, stating that although Ctesias first saw the creature in Persia, it had originally come from India. It is, 
                therefore, perhaps correct to say that it originated in Persian literature but was portrayed as a creature from Indian 
                mythology.</p>

        <h4 >What is a Manticore?</h4>

        <div class="box-whatManti">
            <p class="whatManti-text"> A manticore is a mythological creature that was said to be unconquerable. The mighty beast is 
                best known for its strange but magnificent features. It is often said that the beast had the head of a man, the body 
                of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion. They are thought to be one of the mightiest of beasts and were capable of 
                devouring every animal in the jungle except for elephants. There is no given explanation for why these creatures were 
                unable to defeat elephants, only documentation that for some reason elephants seemed to be able to evade even the most 
                powerful of the manticores.</p>
